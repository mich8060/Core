					Ideas are the true currency of the twenty-first century. So, in order to succeed you need to be able to sell 
					yourself and your ideas persuasively. The ability to sell yourself and your ideas is the single greatest skill 
					that will help you accomplish your dreams. TED Talks have redefined the elements of a successful presentation 
					and become the gold standard for public speaking. TED—which stands for technology, entertainment, and design—brings 
					together the world’s leading innovators and thinkers. Their online presentations have been viewed more than a billion 
					times. These are the presentations that set the world on fire, and the techniques that top TED speakers use are the 
					same ones that will make any presentation more dynamic, fire up any team, and give anyone the confidence to overcome 
					their fear of public speaking.
